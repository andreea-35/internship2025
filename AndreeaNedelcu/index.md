## 27 June 2025
- Started the [Vue Js tutorial]("https://vuejs.org/tutorial/#step-1"), reached part 6. Learned about reactive variables, got accustomed to the flow of code and using directives.

## 28 June 2025
- Completed the remaining parts of the VueJS tutorial, which explored more advanced concepts such as lifecycle and parent-child component communication.
- Started the Tour of rust.

## 29 June 2025
- Completed the first 4 chapters and started chapter 5 of [Tour of Rust]("https://tourofrust.com/index.html"). Remembered concepts learned at the lab (variable types and conversions, control flow structures) while discovering things I missed the first time around (technicalities surrounding returning and variables' lifecycles). 
- Installed [Rustlings]("https://rustlings.rust-lang.org/").

## 30 June 2025
- First day at the office (cleaning!)
- Installed the Helix text editor
- Solved the first 3 chapters of Rustlings exercices and passed the first quiz

## 1 July 2025
- Went through chapters 5 and 6 of the Tour of Rust. Took my time reading and looking things up for chapter 5 as it concerned ownership & borrowing data. Took notes of key concepts and things I think I might forget.
- Solved the primitive types and vectors Rustlings exercices (chapter 4 & 5).

## 2 July 2025
- Solved chapters 6 to 9 of Rustlings exercises (move semantics, structs, enums, strings).

## 3 July 2025
- Solved chapters 10 to 12 of Rustlings exercises (modules, hashmaps, options).

## 4 July 2025
- Did Lab2 on the stm boards. Struggled for a while on the morse code exercise, turned out we had forgotten to include a pause between the dots and dashes, meaning the LEDs just all lit up at the same time, once.

## 7 July 2025
- Started the [Writing an OS in Rust tutorial]("https://os.phil-opp.com/"), completed the first post ["A Freestanding Rust Library"]("https://os.phil-opp.com/freestanding-rust-binary/"). It went a bit differently than described in the post (different error messages), since I'm doing it on MacOS, which slowed my progress for a while, but once I did all of the steps I didn't have any issues.
- Got to the target specification part of the 2nd part of the tutorial (A minimal Rust kernel).

## 8 July 2025
- Switched to rust nightly and installed Qemu. Created the bootable image and printed Hello World.
- Wrote the first enum and function for the printing module.

## 9 July 2025
- Finished writing the module (can print both bytes and strings), added rust format macro support and new line handling.
- Took notes on rust Statics and learned about Lazy Statics. Made the writer into an interface.
- Read on Sync and interior mutability. Learned about spinning mutexes and implemented it for the Writer.

## 10 July 2025
- Started the last part of the Bare Bones part of the tutorial, Testing. Cargo test wouldn't open Qemu, tried some chatgpt fixes and starting from scratch (since chatgpt strayed quite a bit from the tut), but to no avail. 

## 11 July 2025
- Fixed the issue, finally. A step I thought was optional in the previous section of the tutorial, which resulted in an error at the time, turned out to be the key. Cargo test now correctly finds the path to the binary.
- Carried on with the tutorial, smooth sailing. 

## 14-19 July 2025 - break
